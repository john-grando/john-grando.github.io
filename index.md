### About Me
I'm a lifelong student who is passionate about energy efficiency and data science. I have over 6 years of experience performing data analyses, applying transformations, and building machine learning models to provide business intelligence solutions. Additionally, I have been working in the commercial building energy and sustainability sector for over 11 years.

I am the lead developer of [pyExpandObjects](https://github.com/john-grando/pyExpandObjects) which is a pre-processing tool that maps simplified JSON template objects into complex HVAC system components ready for building energy modeling simulation for the [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) software package.

#### EIA Data Analysis and Prediction
---  
When time allows, I work on a tool to extract information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) [bulk download feature](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/bulkfiles.php), and perform some general analyses.

#### Building Energy Consumption Prediction

---  
This is a comprehensive report that explores and transforms a set of survey questions about commercial building characteristics, extracts the most impactful features pertaining to electrical and natural gas consumption, and uses those features to create a deep feed-forward neural network prediction algorithm for each fuel source.

#### New York City Energy Consumption Visualized

---  
This project was created in an effort to showcase some programming and visualization skills I acquired.  It is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript (d3.js), and the Plotly graphing package.  It is a little slow, as it is hosted on a free platform, but it serves the purpose of showing what can be visualized from such data.
